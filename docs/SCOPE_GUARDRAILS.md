# Scope Guardrails

## Not in MVP
- Full auth system (ok to stub user_id)
- Full-blown scraping automation
- Full 3D experience (only scaffolding)
- Perfect OEM-level fitment for every trim/year

## MVP must stay small
- One engine family (13B-REW) is enough
- 1 category tree
- 50–200 parts max to start
- A rules engine that supports simple conditions and messages
