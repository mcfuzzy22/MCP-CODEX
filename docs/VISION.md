# Rotary Engine Builder (PCPartPicker vibes, rotary brain)

## One-liner
An interactive rotary engine build configurator that helps users pick compatible parts, shows real-time completeness, pricing, and warnings, and later supports a 3D “socket” picker like Tarkov presets.

## User Promise
- I can pick an engine family (ex: 13B-REW) and build it system-by-system.
- Every selection instantly updates:
  - completion % and missing parts
  - compatibility warnings/errors
  - cheapest vendor mix and estimated cost
- I can share builds and export a buy list.

## MVP Slice (must ship first)
1) Engine family selection
2) Category tree navigation with ✅/❗ status
3) Add parts + kit expansion
4) Completion + cost panel updates instantly
5) Compatibility warnings (simple rules)
6) Affiliate “Buy” buttons + click tracking (optional but easy)

## North Star (later)
3D sockets + drag/drop selection, price alerts, build gallery, achievement loops.
