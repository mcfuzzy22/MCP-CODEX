- **General Notes**
  - Run all commands from the repository root unless specified.
  - Use the automated script (`tests/test.sh`) for quick structural checks, then perform the manual smoke test steps below.

- **0. Automated Sanity Checks**
  - Run: `bash tests/test.sh`
  - Confirm:
    - Script exits with status code `0`.
    - Output indicates all checks passed (no “FAILED” lines).

- **1. Repository Structure (Matches Requirements & TEST.md §1)**
  - Verify required root directories exist:
    - Run: `ls`
    - Confirm the presence of:
      - `docs/`
      - `agents/`
      - `tasks/`
      - `logs/`
      - `db/`
      - `app/`
  - Confirm each directory is version-controlled / non-empty (or has placeholders):
    - Run for each: `ls <dir>`
    - Confirm at least one file exists in each (`.gitkeep` or similar is acceptable).
  - Confirm there are no `frontend/` or `backend/` directories used for UI:
    - Run: `find . -maxdepth 4 -type d \( -name frontend -o -name backend \)`
    - Confirm:
      - No `frontend/` or `backend/` directories exist at the repo root.
      - No `frontend/` or `backend/` directories exist under `app/`.

- **2. README Content & Accuracy (Matches Requirements & TEST.md §2)**
  - Confirm root README exists:
    - Run: `ls README.md`
    - Confirm the file is present at the repository root.
  - Validate README content:
    - Open: `cat README.md` (or use an editor).
    - Confirm:
      - It states this is a Blazor WebAssembly app.
      - It clearly states that the Blazor app lives in the `app/` directory.
      - It describes the purpose of:
        - `app/` (Blazor app)
        - `docs/`
        - `agents/`
        - `tasks/`
        - `logs/`
        - `db/`
      - It contains prerequisites for running the app (e.g., required or assumed .NET SDK).
      - It includes a “Run Locally” / “Getting Started” section with steps equivalent to:
        1. `cd app`
        2. `dotnet run`
        3. Open the URL printed in the console (e.g. `https://localhost:xxxx`).
      - It does not mention new `frontend/` or `backend/` directories for the UI.
  - Cross-check README vs. actual structure:
    - For each directory or path mentioned in the README, confirm it exists on disk and is correctly named.
    - Ensure there is no contradiction about where the UI lives (must be only `app/`).

- **3. Blazor App Execution (Build/Run) (Matches Requirements & TEST.md §3)**
  - Verify `app/` contains a Blazor WebAssembly project:
    - Run: `ls app`
    - Confirm presence of typical Blazor files/folders:
      - `Program.cs`
      - `Pages/`
      - `wwwroot/`
      - Project file (e.g., `.csproj`).
  - Build check:
    - Run:
      - `cd app`
      - `dotnet build`
    - Confirm:
      - Build completes successfully with no errors.
  - Run check (per README instructions):
    - From repo root:
      - `cd app`
      - `dotnet run`
    - Confirm:
      - The app starts without build/runtime errors in the console.
      - The console outputs a URL (e.g., `https://localhost:xxxx` or `http://localhost:xxxx`).
  - Navigation/UI smoke test:
    - Open the URL from the console in a browser.
    - Confirm:
      - The app loads with a visible main page (no 404/500).
      - Page title and basic content appear as expected.
      - Navigate through obvious main pages (e.g., Home, Counter, Fetch Data, etc. depending on this app’s pages).
      - No unhandled exceptions appear in the browser console.
      - There are no obvious regressions (blank pages, broken navigation, missing layout).
  - Confirm no new `frontend/` or `backend/` folders inside `app/`:
    - From repo root:
      - `find app -maxdepth 4 -type d \( -name frontend -o -name backend \)`
    - Confirm that no such directories are found.

- **4. Changelog Update (Matches Requirements & TEST.md §4)**
  - Confirm `logs/CHANGELOG.md` exists:
    - Run: `ls logs/CHANGELOG.md`
    - Confirm the file is present.
  - Validate content:
    - Run: `cat logs/CHANGELOG.md`
    - Confirm:
      - There is at least one entry referencing this EPIC / retrofit work (e.g., includes text like “EPIC 00”, “Repo retrofit”, or similar).
      - The entry includes:
        - A date or version marker.
        - A brief description of changes (e.g., directory setup, README, Blazor run instructions).
      - The new entry is consistent in formatting with any pre-existing entries (if present), or otherwise uses a simple, readable bullet/datelined style.

- **5. Roster & Agent Alignment (Matches Requirements & TEST.md §5)**
  - Check `/agents` directory:
    - Run: `ls agents`
    - Confirm:
      - At least one placeholder or configuration file exists (e.g., `.gitkeep`, YAML/JSON config, or similar).
      - File naming or comments indicate this directory is for agent definitions/configuration, compatible with “rotary builder” style.
  - Check `/tasks` directory:
    - Run: `ls tasks`
    - Confirm:
      - At least one EPIC/task definition file exists (e.g., `EPIC_00_MVP.md` or similar).
      - File naming or content indicates this directory is for EPIC/task definitions and aligns with the rotary builder project conventions.
  - Cross-check references:
    - If README or comments describe these directories as aligned with the rotary builder conventions, confirm that:
      - Naming and structure appear consistent and unambiguous.
      - There is no conflicting documentation about their purpose.

- **6. Testing & Validation (Tester Focus – Matches Requirements & TEST.md §6)**
  - Follow README instructions exactly:
    - From repo root, execute exactly what the README describes for running the app (e.g. `cd app`, `dotnet run`).
    - Confirm the commands work as described (no missing directories, typos, or wrong paths).
  - Browser smoke test:
    - Use the URL printed by `dotnet run`.
    - Validate:
      - Home page loads successfully (no HTTP 404/500).
      - Any main navigation elements (menu links, router links) work.
      - No unhandled exceptions or severe errors appear in the browser console.
    - Optionally confirm:
      - If EPIC 00 introduced any UI reference to docs/logs (e.g., links), ensure they do not break navigation or cause errors.
  - Documentation vs. reality:
    - Re-compare README with actual behavior:
      - The run commands and URL expectations are accurate.
      - Directory descriptions match actual contents/purposes.
      - There are no mentions of or pointers to non-existent directories or features.
    - Confirm:
      - No mention or presence of `frontend/` / `backend/` directories for the UI anywhere in the repo or README.

- **7. Reporting Deviations**
  - If any check fails, document:
    - The exact step/command used.
    - The observed vs. expected behavior.
    - File paths and relevant snippets (from README or CHANGELOG) that conflict with requirements.
  - Highlight especially:
    - If `dotnet run` from `app/` fails or behaves differently from the README.
    - Any missing required directories or files.
    - Any incorrect documentation about app location or run instructions.
    - Any presence or mention of `frontend/`/`backend/` for the UI.
