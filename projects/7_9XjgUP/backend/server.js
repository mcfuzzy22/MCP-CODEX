// This file is intentionally left as a placeholder.
// The Rotary Engine Interactive Website is implemented as a Blazor WebAssembly
// application running entirely on the client, per REQUIREMENTS.md. No backend
// API endpoints are required for this phase, and no server logic should be
// added here.
//
// To run the actual application, follow the documented steps in README.md:
//   cd app
//   dotnet run
