- General setup
  - Ensure .NET SDK (version specified in README) is installed.
  - From project root, verify the following files exist:
    - README.md (root)
    - docs/API.md
    - logs/CHANGELOG.md
    - app/ (Blazor project directory)
    - TEST.md
  - From project root, run:
    - `cd app`
    - `dotnet restore`
    - `dotnet run`
  - Confirm the app starts without build/runtime errors.

- 1. Home Page Becomes Rotary Builder Landing
  - Open a browser to the root URL (as indicated by `dotnet run`, typically `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`).
  - Verify:
    - The first rendered page is clearly labeled or branded as a “Rotary Builder” landing page (check for heading text like “Rotary Builder” or equivalent).
    - There is an “Engine family” selector control (dropdown or equivalent) that appears functional.
    - There is a prominent “Create Build” button or call-to-action.
    - No legacy dashboard-only landing page content is visible or overlapping.
  - Using browser dev tools Network tab:
    - Select an engine family (if required by UI).
    - Click “Create Build”.
    - Confirm a `POST /api/builds` request is sent.
    - Confirm response status is 200 or 201.
    - Extract the `buildId` from the response payload.
    - Verify the SPA navigates to `/builder/{buildId}` without full browser reload (URL updates, but no full page refresh; Blazor router remains active).

- 2. Builder Page Routing: `/builder/{buildId}`
  - With app running, manually change browser URL to `/builder/test-id`.
  - Verify:
    - The route is recognized (no generic 404 from server/browser).
    - The BuilderPage layout is rendered (left rail, parts center, right summary rail).
    - If `test-id` is not a known build ID, the page shows a “build not found” or similar user-facing error; no unhandled exception UI.
  - From the landing page, create a valid build and let app navigate to `/builder/{real-build-id}`.
  - In Network tab:
    - Confirm `GET /api/builds/{real-build-id}` is issued on page load.
    - Confirm 200 response and that payload includes engine family, selections, completion, cost, warnings.
  - Visually confirm:
    - Initial completion percentage and total cost appear in the right rail and are consistent with the stubbed defaults (e.g., 0% and 0 cost for empty selection, or documented values).

- 3. Left Rail Category Tree (10 Categories)
  - On `/builder/{valid-build-id}`, inspect the left rail.
  - Verify:
    - A clearly defined category list/tree component is present (either by code inspection or by clear visual separation).
    - Exactly 10 categories are visible; count them manually.
    - Category labels are readable and visually distinct as list/tree items.
    - Selecting a category changes its visual state (highlight, bold, or other active indicator).
  - Click multiple different categories:
    - Confirm the active state moves to the clicked category.
    - Confirm the center panel updates its content to represent the selected category.
    - Ensure there is no full page reload (only component-level re-render).

- 4. Center Panel PartsList
  - For several different categories, inspect the center panel (parts list).
  - Verify:
    - The list displays one or more parts for each category, unless documented otherwise.
    - Each part shows at least:
      - A name or title.
      - A numeric or formatted price.
      - A selection control (checkbox, radio, toggle, or button).
    - If using static JSON, verify by code inspection:
      - Static data files exist under `app/wwwroot` (or equivalent).
      - The parts list binds to these sources or to an equivalent static in-memory catalog in C#.
  - Test selection behavior:
    - Select a part; confirm its visual state indicates “selected”.
    - Deselect the same part; confirm it returns to unselected state.
    - Select multiple parts, then:
      - Change to another category.
      - Return to the original category.
      - Verify previous selections are preserved (assuming same build session).
    - Trigger actions that cause normal Blazor re-renders (e.g., switching categories) and verify selections persist as expected.

- 5. Right Rail: SummaryRail and WarningsPanel
  - On `/builder/{valid-build-id}`, inspect the right rail.
  - Verify:
    - There is a distinct summary section showing:
      - Completion percentage (e.g., “Completion: 30%”).
      - Total build cost (e.g., “Total Cost: $XYZ”).
    - There is a warnings panel displaying a list of warnings (even if they are initially static).
    - Labels and layout are clear and not visually broken.
  - With Network tab open:
    - Select and deselect parts in the center panel.
    - Confirm total cost changes immediately and reflects the sum of selected parts.
    - Confirm completion percentage changes based on required-part logic (as per docs or code comments).
    - Confirm warnings list updates when triggered by selection logic (e.g., selecting a conflicting set of parts) or otherwise remains stable if no dynamic rules are implemented.
    - Ensure no full page reload occurs during these operations.

- 6. Real-time Updates & API Contracts
  - Stress-test UI responsiveness:
    - Rapidly select/deselect several parts across categories.
    - Confirm:
      - The UI remains responsive (no hanging, no obvious lag beyond minor acceptable delay).
      - No browser full reload; only Blazor-level updates.
  - Validate write endpoints via direct REST calls:
    - Using curl/Postman or browser dev tools:
      - Call `POST /api/builds/{valid-build-id}/selections` with a valid payload format as described in `docs/API.md`.
      - Check the JSON response contains the fields:
        - `summary`
        - `completion`
        - `cost`
        - `warnings`
      - Verify field types (string/number/array/object) match documentation.
      - Call `DELETE /api/builds/{valid-build-id}/selections` with the documented payload or no body if appropriate.
      - Confirm same response shape and consistent data types.
    - Optionally compare values by:
      - Viewing state via `GET /api/builds/{id}` before and after POST/DELETE.
      - Confirm metrics and selections match UI behavior.

- 7. Backend Stub Endpoints
  - POST /api/builds
    - Use curl or REST client:
      - `POST /api/builds` with no body or minimal body as described in docs.
    - Verify:
      - Status code is 200 or 201.
      - Response JSON includes:
        - An `id` field (buildId) and it appears unique across multiple calls.
        - Initial metrics (`summary`, `completion`, `cost`, `warnings` or other defined fields).
    - Immediately call `GET /api/builds/{id}`:
      - Confirm the build is retrievable and matches data from POST response.
  - GET /api/builds/:id
    - For a valid `id`:
      - Confirm 200 status.
      - Confirm payload includes:
        - Engine family.
        - Selected parts collection.
        - Completion, cost, warnings.
      - Modify selections via POST, then re-GET and confirm updates.
    - For an invalid/nonexistent `id`:
      - Confirm a 404 or documented error status.
      - Confirm error body/message is reasonable (e.g., “Build not found”).
  - POST /api/builds/:id/selections
    - With a known build ID:
      - Send a payload to select one or more parts.
      - Confirm success status (200/204 with body as designed).
      - Confirm response `{summary, completion, cost, warnings}` fields reflect the new selection state.
      - Re-GET build and verify selections and metrics match POST response.
  - DELETE /api/builds/:id/selections
    - For a build with existing selections:
      - Send DELETE call to `/api/builds/{id}/selections` according to docs (with or without body as specified).
      - Confirm success status.
      - Confirm metrics in response show cleared or reset selections (e.g., 0 cost, lower completion, fewer warnings).
      - Re-GET build and verify selections and metrics are cleared/reset.

- 8. Documentation Updates
  - API documentation (`docs/API.md`)
    - Open docs/API.md.
    - Verify:
      - There are sections for:
        - `POST /api/builds`
        - `GET /api/builds/:id`
        - `POST /api/builds/:id/selections`
        - `DELETE /api/builds/:id/selections`
      - Each section includes at least one complete request example and response example with JSON.
      - Field names and shapes in examples match actual behavior (confirm against live responses from manual tests).
      - The description of metrics (summary, completion, cost, warnings) matches their types and semantics.
  - CHANGELOG (`logs/CHANGELOG.md`)
    - Open logs/CHANGELOG.md.
    - Verify:
      - A new line/entry exists for EPIC 02 or Rotary Builder MVP.
      - The entry includes a date or version info consistent with prior entries.
      - It summarizes the Builder MVP implementation.
      - Earlier entries have not been modified (compare git history if necessary).
  - Root README (`README.md`)
    - Open README.md at repo root.
    - Verify:
      - README exists and is non-empty.
      - Contains:
        - A concise description of the Rotary Builder MVP.
        - Prerequisites (e.g., required .NET SDK version; any browser notes).
        - Explicit instructions to run app:
          - `cd app`
          - `dotnet run`
          - How to access the app in the browser (URL).
        - Mentions:
          - Rotary Builder landing page as home.
          - `/builder/{buildId}` behavior and what it shows.

- 9. Regression: Dashboard Simulation Isolation
  - Identify existing dashboard-related routes/pages by:
    - Scanning `app/Pages` and existing navigation menus.
    - Using README or docs to locate dashboard features.
  - Navigate to those dashboard pages in the running app.
  - Perform known interactions/simulations:
    - Confirm they render correctly (no layout corruption from builder styles).
    - Confirm functionality (buttons, controls, data updates) works as before.
  - Check for unintended coupling:
    - Ensure that interacting with dashboard features does not affect builder state (unless explicitly designed).
    - Ensure that builder-specific UI components do not appear on dashboard-only pages.

- 10. Reporting & Tracking
  - For each TEST.md section, maintain a checklist:
    - Mark each acceptance criterion as Pass/Fail.
    - For failures:
      - Record steps to reproduce.
      - Capture relevant API responses or screenshots.
  - After completing all tests:
    - Summarize:
      - Overall status for EPIC 02 (e.g., all criteria met, or list remaining gaps).
      - Any high-risk defects impacting key flows (home page, builder page, API correctness, regressions).
